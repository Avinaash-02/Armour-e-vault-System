#Research on how the Ploygon works 
Developers using Polygon Mumbai are encouraged to migrate to Amoy to continue their testing and development processes. Amoy promises improved scalability and lower gas fees, offering benefits for developers working on blockchain applications.To migrate, developers need to create a new app on the Amoy network via the Alchemy dashboard, update their API URLs, deploy test contracts, and adjust their testing environments accordinglyâ€‹
